# This code was used to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death) following carotid artery stenting using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database in the manuscript entitled "Using machine learning to predict outcomes following carotid artery stenting" by Li and colleagues. The code was written in R verison 4.3.0.
